# debounce-input-decorator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JsCommunity/debounce-input-decorator.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JsCommunity/debounce-input-decorator)

> Decorator to easily create debounced React inputs

## Install

Installation of the [npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/debounce-input-decorator):

```
> npm install --save debounce-input-decorator
```

## Usage

You can apply this decorator either to a DOM element or to any React component as long as it accepts `onChange` and `value` properties.

```js
import debounceDecorator from 'debounce-input-decorator'
import { Input } from 'reactstrap'

const ReactStrapInputDebounced = debounceDecorator(250)(Input)

const DomInputDebounced = debounceDecorator(250)('input')
```

Because you usually need a `input` or `textarea`, those are provided
directly:

```js
import { Input, Textarea } from 'debounce-input-decorator'

<Input
  debounceTimeout={300}
  // ...
/>
```

## Development

# Run the tests
> yarn test

# Continuously compile
> yarn dev

# Continuously run the tests
> yarn dev-test

# Build for production (automatically called by npm install)

```
